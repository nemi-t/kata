Question 2:
The missing details in the user story are essentially the functional rules in the limit values:

* When the start date is the current date: two scenarios can be considered 
1- The repayment status changes from "not started" to the calculated value
2- The repayment status is equal to "not started" until the end of the day

* When the end date is the current date: two scenarios can be considered
1- The repayment status is displayed in blue until the end of the day
2- The repayment status is displayed in red from the start of the day

* When the loan's start date is equal to the loan's end date the functional rules are not specified

For the user interface, the repayment status format is missing.

Question 3:
In this case, the problem appeared because the loan's start date is equal to the current date (repayment status = not started ) which is also equal to the loan's end date (repayment status is displayed in red)
For these reasons I consider that it should be better to change repayment status from "not started" to the calculated value when the loan's start date is equal to the current date.
Also, repayment status should be displayed in blue until the loan's end date is finished.
That's how, in that case repaid status would be equal to 0.09% and would be displayed in blue.
